/**
 * Kinda an uncessary folder tbh, containers the trajectory loader to load all
 * trajectories in the deploy folder on initial code startup. In my mind, this
 * folder would be a sort of "custom class" sort of section, where you write
 * your own sort of processing and practical pieces of functionality for the
 * robot that doesn't necessarily apply to running a command on the robot itself,
 * or a subsystem. Stuff that might be a little outside of WPILib. So... like
 * a logger could maybe go here. Either way, the only thing this folder was
 * used for in 2022 was to have the TrajectoryLoader class go somewhere, you're
 * free to continue using this sort of layout or to just move this class in
 * the future.
